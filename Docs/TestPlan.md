# Test Plan


## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

*Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and regression testing will all be used as part of our testing strategy for the app that compares current job with job offers. We will carry out unit testing to ensure that particular methods and components are correct. The various app modules will be tested for integration to make sure they operate together without any issues. The primary goal of system testing will be to confirm the app's is fully functional. To make sure that new modifications don't have any unforeseen side effects, regression testing will be done.*

### 1.2 Test Selection

*We will use both black-box and white-box testing strategies for test selection. Black-box testing entails creating test cases based solely on the requirements of the app, without taking the internal implementation into account. White-box testing will be carried out by looking at the internal organization of the code and creating test cases to cover various code pathways.*

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

*We will largely evaluate the test cases' quality based on their functional coverage, making sure that all of the app's features have been appropriately tested and the app is fully functional.*

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

*We will track bugs and enhancement requests using a dedicated bug tracking system from JetBrain. We can monitor the progress of problem solving with the aid of the bug tracking system, and we'll make sure that fixing all reported bugs.*

### 1.5 Technology

*We will use JUnit to write and execute our test cases. We will explore automation tools like Selenium for system testing.*
