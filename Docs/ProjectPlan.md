## 1 Introduction

*This product allows a single User the ability to enter information about his/her current job and other job offers he/she may have received. There is a ranking feature as well which will provide the list of entered jobs, ranking them in the order of weight assigned to each attribute of the job. He/She can then use this app to compare current job and job offer of their choice and see how they are similar or different.*
